    <h3>Amazing Wing Recipe!</h3>
    <p>Finger-licking good, Korean-style hot wings made easy and simple. The sauce 
        can be made up to two weeks ahead of time; flavor will intensify.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of soy sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of bbq sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, garlic, vinegar, 
            chile-garlic sauce, pepper, sesame oil, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir into sauce. Remove from heat and
            set aside to cool and thicken.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken wings with lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
        <li>Fry chicken wings in batches of 6 to 8 at a time in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the 
            juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest 
            part of the wing, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place cooked wings into a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
